# About Me!

Hey there! Thanks for visiting my page!<br><br>

I'm a sophomore college student majoring in software engineering
working on a full stack engineering certification from
Codecademy in my free time!<br><br>

This page will eventually be replaced with a more pretty
website, but I'm still learning and figuring out exactly
what my style of website will look like!<br><br>

For now, you can contact me at my personal email (gochases@gmail.com)
if you have any questions or advice for me! :D
